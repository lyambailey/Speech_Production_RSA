# The purpose of this script is to take the RSA searchlight results from individual
# subjects and combine them into a single average searchlight map (one map per
# condition/model)

# Define top_dir

# Define directories
data_dir=${top_dir}/MRIanalyses/quickread
searchlight_dir=${data_dir}/subject_level_output/RSA_output/2_searchlight_results_in_MNI

# Out of an over-abundance of caution, we're going to compute average maps in a
# temporary folder in the group_level_output/RSA_output folder. This ensures
# that no unwanted files get mixed into the average for any model. This is probably
# not necessary, but it does not hurt...

		# and prone to error. Therefore, we're going to define a text string "fslmaths ..."
		# and then use a loop to append each -add statement

		# Start the string off with the first file in our array of filenames
		add_command="fslmaths ${new_searchlight_fns[0]} "
