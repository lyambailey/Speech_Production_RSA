### Information about the contents of this folder
This folder contains all the code used for this project. Scripts are grouped into subfolders corresponding to specific stages/components of the analysis pipeline, and subfolders are numbered in the order in which they should be executed (e.g., you must perform preprocessing and asset creation before you can perform FEAT). `0_custom_functions` contains custom python and matlab functions called by other scripts in the pipeline. 

Within each subfolder, scripts are numbered in the order in which they should be executed. Running scripts in the wrong order will likely cause problems.

**IMPORTANT**: The root directory adopted by all of these scripts is the superordinate project directory (i.e., one level above this folder, containing `MRIdata`, `MRIanalyses`, etc.). The root directory is always read out of `top_dir_win.txt` or `top_dir_linux.txt`, both of which are stored in this folder. This means that, if you wish to download and run our code, you simply need to modify the top_dir file for your OS. As an aside: this pipeline was developed across two computers running Windows and Linux respectively, hence the existence of two top_dir files.
